## Next (Phase 0 → Phase 1)

- [ ] **税理士 / 公認会計士 sign-off** — orchestration-compliance §2–§4 (template: professional-sign-off-record.md)
- [ ] **弁護士 sign-off** — disclaimer + installer copy
- [ ] Backend slice 2: `InstallSession` lifecycle + control DB (Phinx) + `SuiteAudit` recorder (start/complete/fail, app-selection, disclaimer)
- [ ] Backend: `SuiteEnv` / `InstallManifest` / `IntegrationWiring` + `installed-apps` + audit read endpoints
- [ ] Docker Compose installer MVP (Invoice + Clear)
- [ ] Docs relative-link check tool + add to CI (deferred from #22)
- [ ] `composer openapi` PHP validator + add to CI backend job (follow-up to #18/#26)
- [ ] Frontend codegen + `entities/` from OpenAPI (follow-up to #18)

## Blockers

- External installer MVP blocked until professional sign-off records merged.
- Sibling apps need `NENE_SUITE_MODE` env readers (cross-repo Issues).
- Tier A suite wizard depends on sibling release ZIP installers (Invoice Phase 3).

## Handoff

Private meta repo. Compliance model mirrors nene-invoice `accounting-compliance.md`.
Binding trio: scope-contract + orchestration-compliance + disclaimer.
