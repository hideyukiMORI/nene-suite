## Next (Phase 0 → Phase 1)

- [ ] **税理士 / 公認会計士 sign-off** — orchestration-compliance §2–§4 (template: professional-sign-off-record.md)
- [ ] **弁護士 sign-off** — disclaimer + installer copy
- [ ] Backend slice 5: `complete` (`completeInstallSession`) + `InstallManifest` domain — preconditions (disclaimer accepted, apps selected), write manifest (R-05), audit `install_session.completed` + `manifest.created`
- [ ] Backend: `installed-apps` (R-06) + `suite-audit-events` read endpoints; `SuiteEnv` / `IntegrationWiring`
- [ ] Backend: `SuiteEnv` / `InstallManifest` / `IntegrationWiring` + `installed-apps` + `suite-audit-events` read endpoints
- [ ] `NENE_SUITE_CONTROL_DATABASE_URL` resolution + installer ADR (deferred from #28)
- [ ] Docker Compose installer MVP (Invoice + Clear)
- [ ] Docs relative-link check tool + add to CI (deferred from #22)
- [ ] `composer openapi` PHP validator + add to CI backend job (follow-up to #18/#26)
- [ ] Frontend codegen + `entities/` from OpenAPI (follow-up to #18)

## Blockers

- External installer MVP blocked until professional sign-off records merged.
- Sibling apps need `NENE_SUITE_MODE` env readers (cross-repo Issues).
- Tier A suite wizard depends on sibling release ZIP installers (Invoice Phase 3).

## Handoff

Private meta repo. Compliance model mirrors nene-invoice `accounting-compliance.md`.
Binding trio: scope-contract + orchestration-compliance + disclaimer.
