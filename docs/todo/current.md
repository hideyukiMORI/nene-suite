# Current TODO

**Phase 0 — Governance and product design**

## Done

- [x] Issue #1: Governance bootstrap — PR #2
- [x] Issue #3: Installer disclaimer — PR #4
- [x] Issue #5–#6: Review gate + env contract — PR #7
- [x] Issue #8: Orchestration compliance — PR #9
- [ ] Issue #10: Terminology registry — PR pending

## Next (Phase 0 → Phase 1)

- [ ] **税理士 / 公認会計士 sign-off** — orchestration-compliance §2–§4 (template: professional-sign-off-record.md)
- [ ] **弁護士 sign-off** — disclaimer + installer copy
- [ ] Issue #9: Catalog validation script
- [ ] Issue #10: Docker Compose installer MVP (Invoice + Clear)
- [ ] Issue #11: CI workflow (catalog schema + docs link check)

## Blockers

- External installer MVP blocked until professional sign-off records merged.
- Sibling apps need `NENE_SUITE_MODE` env readers (cross-repo Issues).
- Tier A suite wizard depends on sibling release ZIP installers (Invoice Phase 3).

## Handoff

Private meta repo. Compliance model mirrors nene-invoice `accounting-compliance.md`.
Binding trio: scope-contract + orchestration-compliance + disclaimer.
