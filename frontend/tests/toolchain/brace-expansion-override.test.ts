/**
 * Toolchain integrity guard — `overrides` must not break the tools they patch.
 *
 * Why this file exists: on 2026-07-29 a *flat* `"brace-expansion": "^5.0.8"` override was
 * merged to silence GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg. It forced every minimatch onto brace-expansion v5,
 * whose entry point changed shape:
 *
 *     v1/v2  module.exports = expand            // callable
 *     v5     module.exports = { expand, ... }   // named exports only
 *
 * minimatch@3 and @5 do `const expand = require('brace-expansion')` and then call it, so they
 * throw `TypeError: expand is not a function` on any pattern containing a brace.
 *
 * Measured in THIS tree on 2026-07-29 (#409): under a flat override **three of the four**
 * installed minimatch copies throw — eslint-plugin-import, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y (both
 * minimatch@3) and @redocly/openapi-core (minimatch@5) — while `npm run check` and
 * `npm run codegen` both stayed green, because nothing we run happens to pass a brace pattern.
 * Green CI is not the same as a working toolchain. Suite therefore ships a **scoped**
 * `brace-expansion@5` override and allowlists the residual advisory with dev-only evidence
 * (docs/development/dependency-audit.md).
 *
 * The guard: resolve every minimatch actually installed and run a brace pattern through it.
 * Any override that reintroduces the incompatibility fails here instead of hiding.
 *
 * Origin: nene-deal PR #175 (fleet reference); adopted here 2026-07-29 with suite's own
 * measurements. Keep the shape identical so the fleet can diff the guard across repos.
